Astro Makers project to make a weather monitor box for and observatory


Welcome to the plans and instructions for the Alan Sliski and Son Weather Box

The goal is to create an inexpensive device for weather monitoring at a telescope site/observatory. It features:
  - Just two onboard sensors: rain detector and sky/cloud monitor. These are the most important sensors for making 
    the scope safety decision: Is it safe to open the scope enclosure? 
  - Other information can be collected from online API's like https://darksky.net/dev
  - One wire connected to the box: an ethernet cable with POE (Power Over Ethernet) providing the power.
  - Inexpensive. This unit should cost about $150 for parts.
  - Open source Arduino code

Documentation is this readme and the files in the Documentation folder.

Narrative:
- Some pictures of the device: picxxxx.png
- The weather box excel spread sheet has the BOM and two drawings.
- Processor: Arduino Mega + Ethernet shiedl + POE
    The RobotDyn part that combines all three is easier to work with and may be less expensive.
    It also comes with a heat sink: The POE does dump a fair amount of heat.
- The sky sensor is just 4 connections to the board
- The rain sensor needs 12V. For that we need a step up regulator from the nominal 9V of the POE.
- wiring notes ( these supercede any images and drawings you might find.
   - Rain sensor. 
       - dip switches set for "It's Raining":  5 on for rain gauge, 1,2 off for high sensitivity, 3 on for 15 min hysteresis
       - 12V comes off the step up regulator
       - relay output to arduino pin 47. No need for external pullup; internal is set and is adequate
   -
- monitor script
   - The goal is to access the weather box and decide if its safe to be open and make that information available to ACP
   - This is a work in progress. 
   - Output can be a one line report file in the Boltwood format
   - This can be run from a cron or windows scheduled task.
